# Leaderboard\_

The leaderboard website displays scores submitted by different players. It also allows you to submit your score. All data is preserved in the external Leaderboard API service.

The Leaderboard API is connected in order to implement the actions behind the "Refresh" and "Submit" buttons. In the last step, async & await is used to send and receive data from API.
